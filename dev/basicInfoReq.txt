--- make first taste case with .json objects

data checks: 

Assumptions about the data:
1. The city is always "San Francisco". - 
2. There can be ANY number of raining times in a day.
3. A new "sky" value can appear at any time.

Hints: 

Common mistakes:
1. map(...) function is returning an array, not a string. Most of the time, you need to
wrap one more function around map(...). When map(...) returns a one item
array, the result can be sometimes treated as a plain text string but you should not
count on this behavior.
